# Landing Page Project

Landing page is a project that has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. And modified the HTML and CSS files, with java script.


## Main functions

* Adding active class with red color properties in CSS.
* The active class section is highlighted in the navbar.
* Add one more section in HTML document.
* Create the navbar through js using document.createElement(), and element.appendChild()
* When someone click an item from the navigation menu, the link should scroll to the appropriate section using scrollIntoView();
